Now we have this code which given a patient id and date queries ICE and returns an ICE response consisting of a collection of substanceAdministrationProposals. The key elements are 

<substanceAdministrationProposal>
- <proposedAdministrationTimeInterval low>: recommended date in YYYYMMDD format

Next is <substanceAdministrationProposal><substance> with these key elements
- <substanceCode code>: Vaccine or vaccine group code being recommended.
- <substanceCode codeSystem>: “2.16.840.1.113883.3.795.12.100.1” if a vaccine group; “2.16.840.1.113883.12.292” if a vaccine. Note that the calling application must also look at the nested <relatedClinicalStatement> to get all of the parameters for the forecast.

Next is <substanceAdministrationProposal><relatedClinicalStatement>
- <interpretation code>: Interpretation element is repeatable. The code value specifies how ICE should interpret the nested <observationValue>, from this markdown table:
