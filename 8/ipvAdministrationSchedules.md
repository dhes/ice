Add opv vaccine. Here is the discussion with chatGPT

For a child born in 1953 in the U.S. who received all routine immunizations, the expected polio vaccination schedule would have included both the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) once it became available:

	1.	Initial IPV Doses: Before the introduction of OPV, the recommended polio vaccine was the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), developed by Dr. Jonas Salk and first available in 1955. The schedule for IPV in the late 1950s likely included:
	•	3 initial doses of IPV spaced about 4-8 weeks apart, typically starting in infancy.
	2.	Transition to OPV: By the early 1960s, the U.S. started transitioning to the OPV. For your test patient, born in 1953 and likely already vaccinated with IPV, the introduction of OPV would have been:
	•	1 dose of monovalent OPV (Type 1), if administered in 1961.
	•	1 dose of trivalent OPV, introduced around 1963, covering all three strains of the poliovirus.
	3.	Recommended OPV Schedule (starting in the 1960s):
	•	3 doses of OPV, with intervals of about 6-8 weeks between each dose.
	•	A 4th dose (booster) given at school entry age (5-6 years old).

Given your patient’s compliance with all recommended immunizations, they would have likely received both IPV and OPV doses. Since OPV became standard in the 1960s, he may have received additional doses to ensure full coverage with the newer vaccine format, especially if he was of school age during that period.
